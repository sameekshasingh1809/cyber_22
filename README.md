# 💸 Expense Tracker — DBMS Mini Project

A modern **Expense Tracker Web App** built using **React.js**.  
It helps users record, categorize, and analyze their daily expenses and income.  
Data is stored locally using the browser’s **LocalStorage**, which simulates database persistence —  
making this project ideal for a **DBMS-based submission**.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Add new transactions (income or expense)  
✅ Assign categories like Food, Bills, Shopping, Salary, etc.  
✅ Auto-add date and time of each transaction  
✅ Persistent data using **LocalStorage** (remains after refresh)  
✅ Delete individual transactions  
✅ Clear all transactions at once  
✅ Calculate total balance, income, and expense  
✅ Beautiful and modern UI with gradient visuals  
✅ Responsive layout for all screen sizes  

## 🧠 DBMS Concept Mapping

| DBMS Concept | React / App Equivalent |

| Table | Transactions array |
| Record | Each transaction object |
| INSERT | Add Transaction |
| DELETE | Delete Transaction |
| SELECT | Transaction List |
| TRUNCATE | Clear All Transactions |
| Persistent Storage | LocalStorage API |

> This project conceptually represents a DBMS system,  
> where each transaction acts as a record stored in a client-side database.
